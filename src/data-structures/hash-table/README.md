# Hashed Table

|Operation                  |Complexity         |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
|Find                       |O(1)*              |
|Insert                     |O(1)*              |
|Delete                     |O(1)*              |

* - assuming that we have "good" hash function and big enough hash table size so that collisions are rare.
