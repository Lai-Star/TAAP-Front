# Heap Sort

Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection
sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into
a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively
shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest
element and moving that to the sorted region. The 
improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure
rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.
