# Knapsack Problem

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in 
combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with 
a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to 
include in a collection so that the total weight is less 
than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as 
large as possible.

It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is 
constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the 
most valuable items.

Example of a one-dimensional (constraint) knapsack problem: 
which boxes should be chosen to maximize the amount of money 
while still keeping the overall weight under or equal to 15 kg?
