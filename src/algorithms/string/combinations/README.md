# Combinations

When the order doesn't matter, it is a **Combination**.

When the order **does** matter it is a **Permutation**.

**"My fruit salad is a combination of apples, grapes and bananas"**
We don't care what order the fruits are in, they could also be 
"bananas, grapes and apples" or "grapes, apples and bananas", 
its the same fruit salad.
