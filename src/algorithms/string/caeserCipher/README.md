# caeserCipher Algorithm

caeserCipher Algorithm is a type of substitution algorithm in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on

## Complexity

- **Time:** `O(|n|)`
- **Space:** `O(|n|)`
## Example

The the following string `abcde` which is shifted by 1 will change to `bcdef`
