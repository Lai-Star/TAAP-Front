# String Permutations

A permutation, also called an “arrangement number” or “order”, is a rearrangement of 
the elements of an ordered list `S` into a one-to-one correspondence with `S` itself. 
A string of length `n` has `n!` permutation.

Below are the permutations of string `ABC`.

`ABC ACB BAC BCA CBA CAB`

When the order doesn't matter, it is a **Combination**.

When the order **does** matter it is a **Permutation**.
