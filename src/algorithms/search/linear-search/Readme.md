#Linear Search
In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.
Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most n comparisons, where n is the length of the list.
