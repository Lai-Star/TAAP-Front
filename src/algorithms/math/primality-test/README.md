# Primality Test

A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input 
number is prime. Among other fields of mathematics, it is used 
for cryptography. Unlike integer factorization, primality tests 
do not generally give prime factors, only stating whether the 
input number is prime or not. Factorization is thought to be 
a computationally difficult problem, whereas primality testing 
is comparatively easy (its running time is polynomial in the 
size of the input).
